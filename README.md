# Australian Microbiome Initiative Scientific Manual

The Australian Microbiome Initiative Scientific Manual lists and describes the Standard Operating Procedures used to generate data for the Australian Microbiome Initiative. Protocols should be cited from the primary literature, not by reference to this document.  
Protocols have been contributed by consortium members and/or service providers and are organised in the stages of a standard OMICS workflow: 
1.	Sample Collection, 
2.	Contextual Metadata Analytical Procedures, 
3.	OMICS Sample Extraction and Purification Protocols, 
4.	OMICS Sequencing Procedures, 
5.	Bioinformatics.

Individual protocols are represented by a unique code (number) which is recorded in in a contextual database against a corresponding metadata field.  Information relating to contextual database field names, definitions and controlled vocabulary can be found here:
